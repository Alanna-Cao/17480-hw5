/**
 * A class that represents rational numbers (fractions) as exact values in Java.
 * Numbers are stored in reduced form and all arithmetic operations maintain exact precision.
 * This class is immutable - all operations return new RationalNumber instances.
 *
 * Example uses:
 * <pre>
 * // Basic arithmetic
 * RationalNumber a = new RationalNumber(1, 2);    // 1/2
 * RationalNumber b = new RationalNumber(1, 3);    // 1/3
 * RationalNumber c = a.plus(b);                   // 5/6
 * RationalNumber d = a.times(b);                  // 1/6
 *
 * // Chain operations
 * RationalNumber result = a.plus(b).minus(c).times(d);
 *
 * // Working with integers
 * RationalNumber e = new RationalNumber(5);       // 5/1
 * RationalNumber f = e.dividedBy(new RationalNumber(2)); // 5/2
 * </pre>
 *
 * Numbers are always stored in reduced form with a positive denominator.
 * For example, -1/2 is stored as (-1,2) not as (1,-2) or (-2,4).
